## Found a Bug?

If you believe you've found a bug, it’s probably just **quantum uncertainty** in action. Open an issue, and we'll look into it (but don't expect a real solution).

### **Disclaimer**:

**Phetamin is a fictional, parody project**. This entire framework is simply a **satirical concept** made for fun and entertainment. 

- There is no “Sebastian Theodore Ezekiel Francisco Alessandro Nathaniel Israel Emmanuel Sullivan Urijah Nicholas” (unless you *really* find him—then let us know).
- **Phetamin is not affiliated with any real institution**, including PhET Interactive Simulations or any academic research group. This is just a joke.

So, if you were hoping to solve real-world quantum problems… you’re better off reading actual research papers.

## Conclusion

If you’ve made it this far, congratulations on embracing the absurdity of **Phetamin**! It’s a simulation of the *idea* of a quantum framework, but **not** of quantum reality. 

Thank you for your time, and remember: this is all just a simulation.
